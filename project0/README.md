Web Programming with HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap.

I have designed a web site about me and projects done by me.
The first page of my web site is the home page. From this page you can choose to see either my profile or my projects.
I have divided my projects into two pages: Graduation projects and PG projects.
My profile page consists of some information about me like hobbies, strengths and skills.
My Graduation projects page consists of the information about my major project and minro project in my B.tech.
My PG projects page consists of some information about the projects that I have done in my PG.
