        <h2>Mini Project:</h2>
        <p>
            This project is describes the amplification of the audio signals used in the
            sound systems today. This is a simple prototype of the audio amplifier. An amplified
            signal is given to 555 Timer IC which is used in the circuit to produce the PWM
            (Pulse Width Modulated) signal. This PWM signal is given as the input to the
            speakers which give the audio output. Thus an amplified audio output is produced by
            the speaker. This project has a limitation that it cannot amplify the actual voice of
            humans but it amplifies the air blown near the microphone. This takes very low
            power to give the amplified output.

        <p>
            The primary factor required for women safety is a non-lethal attack made by
            the victim to safe guard has form the attackers. The second factor considered is the
            robust ness of the system that sends data about the whereabouts of an individual using
            short message service. The Third factor considered is to make people around aware of
            the situation that an lady at risk is facing and the final factor is to record the event that
            is happening at the scene.</p>
        <p>
            The above factors will be enabled if and only if the emotional parameters of
            the body crosses a particular threshold levelindicating panic, fear and stressed.The
            first levelby informing the neighbors in terms of ringing a buzzer. The next is by
            sending SMS to 3 contacts and police “SHE TEAMS CONTROL ROOM” and finally
            capturing and storing the event using a camera and subsequently in SD card.we have
            also used different sensors like heartbeat sensor, temperature sensor, for recognizing
            emotional change that takes place in the women.It is compact device, simple wearable
            device like hand bag,which can be used by frequent commute girls, office going
            women or any common people who is concerned about safety. When a push button is
            pressed by the women under threat, an electric shock generator will be generated.
            This gives the initial way of preventing the molester from reaching the girl under
            danger. Message in the form of SMS (Short message service) will be sent via GSM to
            the near police control room regarding the situation along with the location via GPS
            of the place where she is facing the problem. A longer buzzer will be switched on so
            that the surrounding people can get the attention so that they can come for help.
