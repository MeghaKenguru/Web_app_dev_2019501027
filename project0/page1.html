        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p> Hello! I am Saimegha. I am born and brought up in Mahabubnagar, Telangana.
            I have done my schooling from Keshava Reddy Concept School, intermediate from Narayana Junior College and B.tech in ECE from Vidya Jyothi Institute of Technology.
            I am currently pursuing my MS in IT from IIIT, Hyderabad. We are a sweet and short family of four memebers. Both of my parents are teachers and my younger sister is studying MBBS 2nd year.
            Since my childhood I have always been hardworking and persistant towards the work I do. I am always ready to take critical feedback and work on it.

        <h2>More About me:</h2>
        <p>My goal is to become a data scientist. I have always wanted to work with Microsoft since I like the company's work culture.</p>
        <p>I have done some projects during my Graduation and Post Graduation. The Graduation projects were done as a group but the PG projects were done individually.
            For more details about my graduation projects check out <a href = "./graduationprojects.html">graduation projects</a>.
            At MSIT as it is learning by doing we do projects for all the courses but only some courses have a single project for over the span of a month. For more details about such projects in my PG check out <a href = "./pgprojects.html">PG projects</a>.
            There I have clearly mentioned the list of projects that are done by me and the technologies used in them.
